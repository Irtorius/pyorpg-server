Running the server

First, the following supporting Python libraries should be installed.

	- Python 2.4 or later
	- Twisted

After this, the game can be started by running the src/main.py file. For
example, in Linux and Mac OS X this can be done from the terminal with the
following commands:

	$ cd src
	$ python main.py
	
You can also run the game by simply executing the launcher script:

    $ sh launcher.sh
